        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Colorado and raised in Utah, and grew up in St. George. 
          Through high school, I competed in welding sculpture competitions, and 
          spent a good amount of time in the woodshop as well. I've grown to love 
          working with my hands, and seeing the outcome of different projects, 
          and how they can be useful to other people as well as myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently got married, and live in South Provo with my husband. I enjoy 
          playing volleyball, racquetball, and other similar sports, as well as 
          spending quality time with my family and friends. I'm hoping to graduate 
          next Fall semester, if things continue to go well.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          Startup Info: I'd like to re-design an existing website for a startup 
          company, if that works okay.
          <br> 
          Key features: Account Login (for composers), survey links, general 
          info, composition upload/download, links to composer websites, 
          composition database search, feedback/request submission.
          <br> 
          Elevator Pitch: Do you know a music lover who wants to find new 
          music? What about a composer who wants to spread their music to 
          others? Quest Haven Publishing is the company to get both jobs 
          done by bringing performers and composers together in one 
          location. This free music catalog will allow performers to 
          search for pieces with unique instrumental combinations, as well 
          as request for new pieces to be added. New composers will also 
          have the opportunity to create an account and upload their 
          scores to be added to the catalog, allowing performers to download 
          and enjoy their contribution. For all things composer and 
          performer related, Quest Haven Publishing can get it done!
