# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.

"link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />" - Used to control the icon that shows in the tab bar of the website.

"hr />" - Creates a dividing line between what's above and below (spans the whole viewport)

Viewport can be controlled, should be specified/programmed for different devices.

Different formatting can be difficult in HTML, CSS is smoother.
